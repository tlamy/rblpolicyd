Urgent fixes/additions
======================
- Add SIGHUP handler
  Reload of config file after changes
- write man page


Minor fixes/additions
=====================
- remove debugging from parts that simply work
- write script to parse maillog (spam found by amavis/spamass)
  to help tweak the weights
- more statistics (# of dns queries runtime/per conn/per sec)
- Perhaps add some caching of client ip's (although that's
  what DNS caching is for)

Things that probably won't change
=================================
- no caching of DNS answers
