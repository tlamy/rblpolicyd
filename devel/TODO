Urgent fixes/additions
======================
- Fix SIGTERM handling
  (shutdown takes place at next new connection)
- Add SIGHUP handler
  Reload of config file after changes
- parallel DNS queries
- write man page


Minor fixes/additions
=====================
- free configuration linked-list on shutdown
- remove debugging from parts that simply work
- write script to parse maillog (spam found by amavis/spamass)
  to help tweak the weights
- more statistics (# of dns queries runtime/per conn/per sec)

Other ideas
===========
- perhaps rewrite to be multi-threaded


Things that won't change
========================
- no caching of DNS answers
