	rblpolicyd - a policy daemon for RBLs with Postfix (http://www.postfix.org/)

  Copyright (C) 2004 Thomas Lamy

  This is a policy-daemon for postfix. It proxies and caches DNS requests for a number of
  realtime blacklists (RBLs), applies weights to the individual answers, and sends the result back to postfix.
  All DNS requests are made in separate threads, to provide best possible performance even with cold caches.
