	* Multi-threading is here (in two stages)
	  Stage 1 (workers) is where client connections are threaded.
	  Limit is set via the -m <limit> switch, default is 10
	  Stage 2 (solvers) is where DNS queries are made. The number of
	  parallel resolvers is _not_ limited. Note that on some thread
	  implementations (where threads are processes, like Linux 2.4) this
	  will actually result in more system load.
	* Fixed some memory leaks (but most if not all of them were one-timers
	  and not increasing at run-time)
	* All allocated memory is now properly initialized; valgrind show no
	  errors
	* The SIGHUP (reload database) handler is implemented but not active
	  yet (needs testing)
	* Added init script for Debian
